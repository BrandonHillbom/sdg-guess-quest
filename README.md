# SDG Guess Quest

## United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
SDG 4: Quality education
SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals

## Project Idea
My project, SDG Guess Quest, is a mobile app that combines the classic 'Guess Who' game format with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to educate and engage users in an interactive, fun, and educational experience while raising awareness about global sustainability challenges.

## Project background/Business Opportunity
In a world marked by pressing global challenges, raising awareness and fostering collective action is imperative. My project, SDG Guess Quest, is driven by the urgency to engage and educate the youth of North America about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These 17 goals, addressing issues from climate change to poverty eradication, serve as a roadmap for a sustainable and equitable future. However, the need for innovative and interactive solutions to bring these goals to the forefront of public consciousness has never been greater.

The game combines the beloved 'Guess Who' format with the vital mission of spreading awareness about the SDGs. By gamifying learning and social interaction, I aim to inspire a new generation of global citizens who are not only aware of the SDGs but actively committed to achieving them. The innovation lies in the fusion of entertainment and education, leveraging technology to transform abstract concepts into tangible learning experiences. This project seeks to bridge the gap between individual understanding and collective action, aligning with the global call for a more sustainable and inclusive world.
